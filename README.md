# ChessBot
## Overview
This is a simulated chess playing robot created for MIT's Course on [Robotic Manipulation](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/).
It uses a combination of Deep Perception (Mask R-CNN, ICP), Chess Engine (Stockfish), and Differential Inverse Kinematics (Drake) to percieve and
manipulated pieces on a chess board.  Running the `ipynb` files in demos
allows a user to play against the robot, as well as experiment with the simulation and perception systems.



## Setup
1. Create a virtual enviroment.
2. Install [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/) locally.
3. From the main ChessBot directory, run `setup.py develop` or `setup.py install` to develop or install ChessBot.
